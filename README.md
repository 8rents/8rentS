Hello Everyone, I'm 8rent's. My actual name is Brenton Holiday.

I used to be a developer based in Portland, OR, however now I am based out of San Francisco, CA.

Most of the fun of my development practices comes from the odd necessity of developing without:

1. Owning a digital device
2. Regarding any device that I have as extremely temporary 
3. Not having any admin rights or elevated privilege's on computers I am lucky enough to work on

This is a process that I call *Ephemeral Computing*.

There has been many iterations of this workflow however feel free to [check out the latest / current spec]([https://github.com/8rentS/ephemeral-computing).

**I hope so sincerely that some unfortunate soul finds some information here that can be useful**.
